# Mean Median Skewness Relationship

#### You:
explain to me the general relationship between the mean and median and "right" and "left" skewness

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! The mean and median are measures of central tendency, and their relationship can give insights into the skewness of a distribution.

1. **Mean vs. Median:**
   - **Mean:** This is the average of all data points in a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
   - **Median:** This is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.

2. **Skewness:**
   - **Right (Positive) Skewness:** A distribution is right-skewed if it has a longer tail on the right side. In this case, the mean is typically greater than the median. This happens because the mean is pulled in the direction of the tail more than the median.
   - **Left (Negative) Skewness:** A distribution is left-skewed if it has a longer tail on the left side. Here, the mean is usually less than the median. The mean is pulled in the direction of the tail on the left side, causing it to be lower than the median.

**Summary:**

- In a **right-skewed** distribution, the mean > median.
- In a **left-skewed** distribution, the mean < median.

In a perfectly symmetric distribution (like a normal distribution), the mean and median are equal.


#### You:
simpify it. don't use fancy words or explain each. for example what is central tendancy and etc

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here’s a simpler explanation:

- **Mean**: Add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.
- **Median**: The middle number when you put the numbers in order.

**Skewness**:

- **Right Skewed**: The tail of the data is on the right side. The mean is usually bigger than the median.
- **Left Skewed**: The tail of the data is on the left side. The mean is usually smaller than the median.

So, if the mean is bigger than the median, the data is right skewed. If the mean is smaller than the median, the data is left skewed.


#### You:
Okay now make it one level more advanced. 

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here’s a slightly more advanced explanation:

- **Mean**: This is the average of all the values in your dataset.
- **Median**: This is the middle value when you sort the data from lowest to highest.

**Skewness**:

- **Right (Positive) Skewness**: The distribution has a longer tail on the right side. The mean will be higher than the median because the mean gets pulled in the direction of the tail.
- **Left (Negative) Skewness**: The distribution has a longer tail on the left side. The mean will be lower than the median because the mean gets pulled towards the tail on the left.

So, when the mean is greater than the median, the data is right-skewed. When the mean is less than the median, the data is left-skewed.


#### You:
now explin to me what teh following code does in the context of this dicussing:

from scipy import stats
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
 
sample1 = stats.gamma(a=2,scale=2).rvs(size=1000)
fig1 = px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({'data': sample1}), x="data")
# USE `fig1.show(renderer="png")` FOR ALL GitHub and MarkUs SUBMISSIONS

sample1.mean()
np.quantile(sample1, [0.5]) # median

sample2 = -stats.gamma(a=2,scale=2).rvs(size=1000)

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, let’s break down what this code does in the context of mean, median, and skewness:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - `scipy.stats` is used for statistical functions.
   - `pandas` and `numpy` are used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
   - `px` (likely Plotly Express) is used for plotting.

2. **Generate Data**:
   - `sample1 = stats.gamma(a=2, scale=2).rvs(size=1000)`: This generates 1000 random values from a gamma distribution with shape parameter `a=2` and scale parameter `scale=2`. This distribution is right-skewed.

3. **Plot Data**:
   - `fig1 = px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({'data': sample1}), x="data")`: This creates a histogram of the `sample1` data to visualize its distribution.

4. **Calculate Mean and Median**:
   - `sample1.mean()`: This calculates the mean (average) of the `sample1` data.
   - `np.quantile(sample1, [0.5])`: This calculates the median of the `sample1` data (50th percentile).

5. **Generate Another Data Sample**:
   - `sample2 = -stats.gamma(a=2, scale=2).rvs(size=1000)`: This generates 1000 random values from a gamma distribution, but with the values negated. This flips the distribution to be left-skewed (the tail is now on the left side).

**Summary**:

- `sample1` represents a right-skewed distribution. For this data, the mean will be higher than the median.
- `sample2` represents a left-skewed distribution. For this data, the mean will be lower than the median.
