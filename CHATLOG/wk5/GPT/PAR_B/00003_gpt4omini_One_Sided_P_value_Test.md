What is a "one sided" (or "one tailed") p-value test?

A "one-sided" or "one-tailed" p-value test is a type of statistical hypothesis test that assesses the significance of the observed data in only one direction of the distribution. This contrasts with a "two-sided" or "two-tailed" p-value test, which assesses significance in both directions.

### Key Concepts

#### Example Scenario

Suppose you are testing whether a new drug is more effective than a standard drug. You have the following hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The new drug is as effective as the standard drug (mean difference = 0).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The new drug is more effective than the standard drug (mean difference > 0).

In this case, you are interested only in whether the new drug has a greater effect, not in whether it has a smaller effect.

#### One-Sided Test

In a one-sided test, you only test for the possibility of the effect being in one direction. For the example above, you would perform a one-sided test to see if the mean effect of the new drug is significantly greater than that of the standard drug.

- **One-Sided Test p-value:** This p-value measures the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained, assuming that the null hypothesis is true and the effect is only in the direction specified by the alternative hypothesis.

#### Survivorship Bias in Action

Imagine a study where researchers test a new teaching method to see if it improves test scores. They use a one-sided test to determine if the new method increases scores compared to the old method. If the test only considers improvements (and not decrements), they might overlook scenarios where the new method might actually reduce scores or have no effect.

#### Real-Life Implications

- **Choosing a One-Sided Test:** You should use a one-sided test if you have a clear, directional hypothesis and are only interested in testing for effects in one direction. For example, testing if a new material is stronger than an existing one (but not weaker).
- **Risk of Misinterpretation:** If you choose a one-sided test when a two-sided test is more appropriate (e.g., when you are equally interested in detecting increases or decreases), you may miss important information about the other direction.

In summary, a one-sided p-value test is useful when you have a specific hypothesis about the direction of an effect, and it helps to focus the statistical test on that particular direction.

Memory updated

To compute a p-value for a one-sided (or one-tailed) hypothesis test using the bootstrap method, you'll need to modify your code to test for a specific direction of the effect. Here’s how you can adjust your code:

### Adjusted Code for One-Sided Hypothesis Test

#### Hypothesis

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The vaccine has no effect on patients (mean change in health score = 0).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The vaccine has a positive effect on patients (mean change in health score > 0).

In this case, you want to determine if the average health score change is significantly greater than zero.

#### Modified Code

python

Copy code

`import pandas as pd import numpy as np  # Create the DataFrame patient_data = pd.DataFrame({     "PatientID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],     "Age": [45, 34, 29, 52, 37, 41, 33, 48, 26, 39],     "Gender": ["M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F"],     "InitialHealthScore": [84, 78, 83, 81, 81, 80, 79, 85, 76, 83],     "FinalHealthScore": [86, 86, 80, 86, 84, 86, 86, 82, 83, 84] })  # Compute HealthScoreChange patient_data['HealthScoreChange'] = patient_data['FinalHealthScore'] - patient_data['InitialHealthScore']  # Bootstrapping number_of_simulations = 1000 n_size = len(patient_data) bootstrap_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)  for i in range(number_of_simulations):     # Bootstrap sample     sample = patient_data.sample(n=n_size, replace=True)     bootstrap_means[i] = sample['HealthScoreChange'].mean()  # Calculate the p-value for a one-sided test observed_mean_change = patient_data['HealthScoreChange'].mean()  # For a one-sided test (testing if mean change > 0): p_value = np.mean(bootstrap_means <= 0)  # p-value for the one-sided test  # Output results print(f'Observed Mean Change: {observed_mean_change}') print(f'Bootstrap p-value (one-sided): {p_value}')`

### Explanation

1. **Compute HealthScoreChange:** Calculate the difference between `FinalHealthScore` and `InitialHealthScore` to get the health score change for each patient.
    
2. **Bootstrapping:** Resample the data with replacement and compute the mean health score change for each bootstrap sample.
    
3. **Calculate p-value:** For a one-sided test (testing if the mean change is greater than zero), calculate the p-value as the proportion of bootstrap means that are less than or equal to zero.
    
4. **Output Results:** The `p_value` indicates the proportion of bootstrap samples where the mean change was less than or equal to zero, which tests the null hypothesis that the mean change is not greater than zero.
    

This adjustment will help you test whether the vaccine has a statistically significant positive effect on the patients.

### Code Changes

In your original code, you performed a two-sided (or two-tailed) test by calculating a confidence interval for the mean health score change. Here’s a summary of what changed and why:

#### Original Code (Two-Sided Test)

1. **Bootstrap Confidence Interval Calculation:**
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `# Bootstrapping number_of_simulations = 1000  n_size = len(patient_data)   bootstrap_means = np.zeros(1000)    for i in range(number_of_simulations):     sample = patient_data.sample(n=n_size, replace=True)     bootstrap_means[i] = sample['HealthScoreChange'].mean()  # Calculate the 95% confidence interval ci_lower = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5) ci_upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5) ci_lower, ci_upper`
    
    - **Interpretation:** The confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values within which the true mean is likely to lie. If zero is not within this range, it suggests that the observed mean change is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

#### Modified Code (One-Sided Test)

1. **One-Sided Test Calculation:**
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `# Compute HealthScoreChange patient_data['HealthScoreChange'] = patient_data['FinalHealthScore'] - patient_data['InitialHealthScore']  # Bootstrapping number_of_simulations = 1000 n_size = len(patient_data) bootstrap_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)  for i in range(number_of_simulations):     sample = patient_data.sample(n=n_size, replace=True)     bootstrap_means[i] = sample['HealthScoreChange'].mean()  # Calculate the p-value for a one-sided test observed_mean_change = patient_data['HealthScoreChange'].mean() p_value = np.mean(bootstrap_means <= 0)  # p-value for the one-sided test  # Output results print(f'Observed Mean Change: {observed_mean_change}') print(f'Bootstrap p-value (one-sided): {p_value}')`
    
    - **Interpretation:** The p-value measures the proportion of bootstrap samples where the mean health score change is less than or equal to zero. A low p-value indicates that the observed mean change is unlikely to be due to random chance if the true effect were zero.

### Interpretation of Hypothesis Test

- **Two-Sided Test:** Tests for deviations in both directions (greater than and less than zero). A p-value less than 0.05 would suggest that the observed mean is significantly different from zero in either direction.
    
- **One-Sided Test:** Tests for deviations in only one direction (e.g., mean > 0). A p-value less than 0.05 would suggest that the observed mean is significantly greater than zero.
    

### Expectation of p-Value

- **One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed:** Typically, you would expect the p-value for a one-tailed test to be smaller than that for a two-tailed test when testing in the direction specified by the one-tailed hypothesis. This is because the one-tailed test focuses on only one end of the distribution, making it easier to find significant results in that direction compared to a two-tailed test which splits the alpha level between both ends.

### Summary

- The one-sided test calculates a p-value based on only one direction of the effect, making it more focused but potentially more lenient in finding significance in that direction compared to the two-sided test.
- The p-value for a one-sided test is expected to be smaller than or equal to that of the two-sided test when the effect is in the hypothesized direction, indicating stronger evidence against the null hypothesis in the specified direction.
