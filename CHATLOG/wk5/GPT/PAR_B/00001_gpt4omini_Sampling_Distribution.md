### Sampling Distribution Under the Null Hypothesis

The sampling distribution under the null hypothesis refers to the distribution of a test statistic (e.g., mean, proportion, etc.) that would be observed if the null hypothesis were true. The null hypothesis often represents a baseline or no-effect scenario. Here’s a brief overview:

#### **Key Points**

1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** A statement that there is no effect or no difference. For example, in a test comparing means, H₀ might state that the mean difference between two groups is zero.
    
2. **Test Statistic:** A standardized value used to determine how far the sample statistic deviates from the null hypothesis. Common test statistics include t, z, and chi-square.
    
3. **Sampling Distribution:** The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. It tells us how much variability we can expect in the test statistic if we were to repeatedly sample from the population.
    
4. **Shape of Distribution:** Depends on the test statistic and sample size. For large samples, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, even if the underlying population distribution is not normal.
    
5. **Critical Value:** The cutoff point(s) beyond which the null hypothesis is rejected. This depends on the significance level (α), such as 0.05 or 0.01.
    

#### **Example Scenario**

If you are testing whether a new teaching method has an effect on test scores, your null hypothesis (H₀) might be that the mean test scores with the new method are the same as with the old method. If H₀ is true, the sampling distribution of the test statistic (e.g., the difference in means) should follow a normal distribution centered around zero.

### p-Value and Code Example

The p-value measures the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.

#### **Calculation of p-Value**

1. **Compute Test Statistic:** Calculate the test statistic (e.g., t-statistic) based on sample data.
    
2. **Determine Sampling Distribution:** Identify the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis (e.g., normal or t-distribution).
    
3. **Find p-Value:** The p-value is the area under the sampling distribution curve beyond the test statistic. It can be computed using statistical functions or tables.
    

#### **Code Example in Python**

Here's how you might compute the p-value in Python using SciPy for a t-test:

python

Copy code

`import scipy.stats as stats  # Example data sample_mean = 5.2 population_mean = 5.0 sample_std = 0.8 sample_size = 30  # Calculate the t-statistic t_statistic = (sample_mean - population_mean) / (sample_std / (sample_size ** 0.5))  # Calculate the p-value (two-tailed test) p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.t.cdf(abs(t_statistic), df=sample_size-1))  print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic}") print(f"P-value: {p_value}")`

In this code:

- `stats.t.cdf` calculates the cumulative distribution function for the t-distribution.
- The p-value is doubled because we are conducting a two-tailed test.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis.

What is Bootstrapped sampling distribution; Why do we even need the concept of sampling distribution

#### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

### Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution

**Bootstrapping** is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data. This method is particularly useful when theoretical distributions are complex or unknown.

#### **Key Concepts**

1. **Bootstrapping:**
    
    - **Definition:** A method of estimating the distribution of a statistic (e.g., mean, median) by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original data.
    - **Purpose:** To approximate the sampling distribution of the statistic, which can be used to estimate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing.
2. **Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution:**
    
    - **Process:** Generate multiple bootstrap samples (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000 samples) from the original dataset. For each sample, compute the statistic of interest. The distribution of these computed statistics forms the bootstrapped sampling distribution.
    - **Application:** Useful for estimating standard errors, confidence intervals, and making inferences about the population.

#### **Example Scenario**

Suppose you have a small dataset and want to estimate the confidence interval for the mean. Using bootstrapping, you create multiple resampled datasets from the original data, compute the mean for each resample, and then use the distribution of these means to estimate the confidence interval.

### Why We Need the Concept of Sampling Distribution

**Sampling distribution** is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) varies from sample to sample. It provides a foundation for inferential statistics, which involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data.

#### **Importance of Sampling Distribution**

1. **Understanding Variability:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Sampling distributions help quantify the variability of sample statistics. For instance, knowing how sample means vary helps assess the reliability of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.
2. **Inferential Statistics:**
    
    - **Hypothesis Testing:** Sampling distributions allow us to test hypotheses by comparing sample statistics to the distribution under the null hypothesis.
    - **Confidence Intervals:** They help calculate confidence intervals for estimates by providing the range within which the population parameter is likely to lie with a certain probability.
3. **Decision Making:**
    
    - **Predictive Power:** Understanding the distribution of a statistic helps in making informed decisions, such as whether to accept or reject hypotheses or whether a sample statistic significantly deviates from the hypothesized value.
4. **Real-World Application:**
    
    - **Practical Use:** In practice, we often deal with sample data rather than entire populations. Sampling distributions provide a way to generalize findings from samples to populations and make statistical inferences.

### Example Code for Bootstrapping in Python

Here’s how you might perform bootstrapping to estimate the confidence interval for the mean of a dataset:

python

Copy code

`import numpy as np  # Original data data = np.array([2.3, 4.1, 5.5, 6.2, 3.8])  # Number of bootstrap samples n_bootstraps = 10000  # Store bootstrap means bootstrap_means = np.zeros(n_bootstraps)  # Perform bootstrapping for i in range(n_bootstraps):     bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(data, size=len(data), replace=True)     bootstrap_means[i] = np.mean(bootstrap_sample)  # Calculate confidence intervals lower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5) upper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)  print(f"Bootstrap Mean Confidence Interval: ({lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f})")`

In this code:

- We generate multiple bootstrap samples and compute their means.
- The confidence interval is derived from the percentiles of the bootstrapped means.

Bootstrapping provides a way to estimate the sampling distribution without relying on strong assumptions about the data’s distribution, making it a versatile tool in statistical analysis.

This code performs a detailed analysis and visualization of a hypothesis test using a bootstrapped sampling distribution. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what it does:

### **1. Understanding "As or More Extreme"**

**Code:**

python

Copy code

`population_parameter_value_under_H0 = 0.5  observed_test_statistic = (patient_data.HealthScoreChange>0).mean() simulated_test_statistics = IncreaseProportionSimulations_underH0random  SimTestStats_as_or_more_extreme_than_ObsTestStat = \     abs(simulated_test_statistics - population_parameter_value_under_H0) >= \     abs(observed_test_statistic - population_parameter_value_under_H0)       print('''Which simulated test statistics are "as or more extreme" than the observed test statistic? (of ''', observed_test_statistic, ')', sep="")  pd.DataFrame({'(Simulated) Test Statistic': simulated_test_statistics,               '>= '+str(observed_test_statistic)+" ?": ['>= '+str(observed_test_statistic)+" ?"]*number_of_simulations,                '"as or more extreme"?': SimTestStats_as_or_more_extreme_than_ObsTestStat})`

**Explanation:**

- **Hypothesized Population Parameter (H₀):** This is set to 0.5, which represents the value of the parameter under the null hypothesis.
- **Observed Test Statistic:** This is computed from the patient data, representing the proportion of patients with positive health score changes.
- **Simulated Test Statistics:** These are generated under the null hypothesis, simulating what test statistics would look like if H₀ were true.
- **Comparison:** Determines which simulated test statistics are "as or more extreme" compared to the observed test statistic. This is based on the absolute difference from the hypothesized value.
- **Output DataFrame:** Displays the simulated test statistics, whether they are greater than or equal to the observed test statistic, and whether they are "as or more extreme".

### **2. Visualization with Plotly**

**Explanation:**

- **Histogram Data:** Uses the bootstrapped sample means with a slight random adjustment to visualize the distribution.
- **Plot Creation:** Creates a distribution plot (`create_distplot`) for the bootstrapped sampling distribution under the null hypothesis.
- **Observed Test Statistic:** Adds a green vertical line indicating the observed test statistic, and a label for clarity.
- **Symmetric Test Statistic:** Computes and adds another green vertical line for the symmetric observed test statistic.
- **Confidence Interval Regions:** Adds shaded rectangles to show regions "as or more extreme" than the observed test statistic (both lower and upper tails).
- **Layout Updates:** Sets the plot title, axis labels, and y-axis range, then displays the plot.

### **Summary**

This code helps in visualizing and understanding the concept of "as or more extreme" test statistics in the context of hypothesis testing:

- **Calculates and compares:** Determines which simulated test statistics are as extreme or more extreme than the observed statistic.
- **Visualizes:** Provides a clear graphical representation of the bootstrapped sampling distribution, observed test statistic, symmetric test statistic, and extreme regions, aiding in the interpretation of p-values and hypothesis testing results.

##### You said:

What is the difference in the "middle value" of "the bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean" VERSUS "the bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean under the (assumption of) null hypothesis?"

#### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The "middle value" of a sampling distribution often refers to the central tendency of the distribution, typically measured by the mean or median. In hypothesis testing and bootstrapping contexts, the difference between the "middle value" of the bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean and the "middle value" of the bootstrapped sampling distribution under the null hypothesis can provide insights into the effect of the null hypothesis on the data. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### **1. Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean**

**Definition:**

- This distribution is created by repeatedly resampling with replacement from the observed data and calculating the sample mean for each resample.

**Middle Value:**

- **Mean:** The average of the bootstrapped sample means.
- **Median:** The middle value when the bootstrapped sample means are sorted in ascending order.

**Purpose:**

- To estimate the sampling distribution of the sample mean based on the observed data.
- Provides a way to understand the variability and distribution of the sample mean if the observed data were representative of the entire population.

### **2. Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean under the Null Hypothesis**

**Definition:**

- This distribution is created by simulating data under the null hypothesis and then resampling from this simulated data to compute sample means. The null hypothesis often assumes no effect or difference (e.g., the population mean is equal to a specific value).

**Middle Value:**

- **Mean:** The average of the bootstrapped sample means simulated under the null hypothesis.
- **Median:** The middle value of the bootstrapped sample means under the null hypothesis.

**Purpose:**

- To understand the distribution of the sample mean under the null hypothesis.
- Provides a benchmark for comparing the observed sample mean to see if it is unusual or extreme under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

### **Differences in Middle Values**

1. **Context of Data:**
    
    - **Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean:** Reflects the variability of the sample mean based on actual observed data.
    - **Bootstrapped Sampling Distribution under the Null Hypothesis:** Reflects the variability of the sample mean if the null hypothesis were true.
2. **Interpreting the Middle Value:**
    
    - **For the Observed Data:** The middle value (mean or median) indicates the central tendency of the observed sample means.
    - **For the Null Hypothesis:** The middle value indicates the central tendency of sample means expected under the null hypothesis.
3. **Implications for Hypothesis Testing:**
    
    - **Observed Data Middle Value:** Used to assess how extreme or typical the observed sample mean is.
    - **Null Hypothesis Middle Value:** Provides a reference point to evaluate whether the observed sample mean is statistically significant or not.

### **Example in Practice**

- **Observed Data:** Suppose the observed sample mean is 5, and the bootstrapped sampling distribution of this mean has a middle value of 5. This suggests that the observed mean is consistent with the variability expected in the sample means from the observed data.
- **Null Hypothesis:** Suppose the null hypothesis posits that the population mean is 4. The bootstrapped sampling distribution of the mean under the null hypothesis might have a middle value of 4. If the observed mean is much different from this value (e.g., 5 vs. 4), it suggests that the observed sample mean is unusual under the null hypothesis, potentially leading to rejection of H₀.

### **Summary**

The main difference between the middle values of these distributions is the context in which they are derived. The middle value of the bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean reflects the data you actually have, while the middle value under the null hypothesis reflects what you would expect if the null hypothesis were true. Comparing these values helps in determining if the observed data is consistent with or significantly different from what is expected under the null hypothesis.
