can one be a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis

#### ChatGPT:
In practical terms, it would be extremely challenging to be a statistician or data scientist without coding or doing data analysis. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Coding**: Coding skills are fundamental for data scientists and statisticians because they are used to manipulate data, perform statistical analyses, create models, and visualize results. Programming languages like Python, R, SQL, and others are commonly used in these roles to handle large datasets and automate processes.

2. **Data Analysis**: Data analysis is at the core of both statistical work and data science. Statisticians use data analysis techniques to interpret data, test hypotheses, and make predictions based on statistical models. Data scientists use similar techniques along with machine learning algorithms to extract insights and build predictive models.

While the level of coding and data analysis required can vary depending on the specific role and industry, these skills are typically essential for performing the duties effectively. They enable professionals to extract meaningful information from data, communicate findings, and contribute to decision-making processes.

Without coding and data analysis skills, one may find it difficult to perform the tasks expected of a statistician or data scientist. These skills not only enhance productivity and efficiency but also open up opportunities for innovation and deeper understanding of complex datasets. Therefore, acquiring proficiency in coding and data analysis is highly recommended for anyone aspiring to pursue a career in statistics or data science.
