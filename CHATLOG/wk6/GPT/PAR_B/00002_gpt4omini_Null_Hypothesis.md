To address the question, let's break it down step-by-step:

### 1. Null Hypothesis for Simple Linear Regression

In the context of Simple Linear Regression (SLR), we typically test hypotheses about the slope of the regression line. The null hypothesis (H₀) of "no linear association (on average)" can be stated in terms of the regression parameters:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The slope of the regression line (β₁) is zero, which means there is no linear association between the predictor variable (waiting time) and the response variable (duration).

Formally: H0:β1=0H_0: \beta_1 = 0H0​:β1​=0

### 2. Analyzing the Old Faithful Geyser Dataset

Let's interpret the code provided:

python

Copy code

`import seaborn as sns import statsmodels.formula.api as smf  # The "Classic" Old Faithful Geyser dataset old_faithful = sns.load_dataset('geyser')  linear_for_specification = 'duration ~ waiting' model = smf.ols(linear_for_specification, data=old_faithful) fitted_model = model.fit() fitted_model.summary()`

This code performs the following:

1. **Loads the dataset:** `old_faithful` is a DataFrame containing the "Old Faithful" geyser eruption data, including the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of eruptions.
2. **Specifies and fits a linear model:** A Simple Linear Regression model is specified where `duration` is the dependent variable and `waiting` is the independent variable. The model is then fitted using ordinary least squares (OLS).
3. **Generates a summary:** The `fitted_model.summary()` function provides a detailed summary of the regression results.

### 3. Interpreting the Results

The summary output will include several key statistics:

- **Coefficients:** The estimated coefficients for the intercept and the slope (waiting time). Focus on the slope coefficient (β₁) and its corresponding p-value.
- **P-value:** The p-value for the slope coefficient tests the null hypothesis that the slope is zero.

To assess the evidence against the null hypothesis:

1. **Check the p-value for the slope coefficient (waiting time):** If the p-value is below a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis, suggesting there is a significant linear association between waiting time and eruption duration.
    
2. **Look at the confidence interval for the slope coefficient:** If the confidence interval does not include zero, this also supports rejecting the null hypothesis.
    

### 4. Interpretation of Beliefs

Based on the regression results from the Old Faithful dataset:

- If the p-value for the waiting time coefficient is very small (e.g., less than 0.05), you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant linear association between waiting time and eruption duration.
- If the p-value is larger, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the evidence does not strongly support a linear relationship between these variables.

The `fitted_model.summary()` output will provide these details. You can use the following interpretation to shape your beliefs:

- **Significant Result:** There is strong evidence to suggest that waiting time is linearly associated with eruption duration.
- **Non-Significant Result:** There is insufficient evidence to suggest a linear association between waiting time and eruption duration.

As seen in the introductory figure above, if the delay of the geyser eruption since the previous geyser eruption exceeds approximately 63 minutes, there is a notable increase in the duration of the geyser eruption itself. In the figure below we therefore restrict the dataset to only short wait times. Within the context of only short wait times, is there evidence in the data for a relationship between duration and wait time in the same manner as in the full data set? Using the following code, characterize the evidence against the null hypothesis in the context of short wait times which are less than short_wait_limit values of 62, 64, 66. import plotly.express as px short_wait_limit = 62 # 64 # 66 # short_wait = old_faithful.waiting < short_wait_limit print(smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[short_wait]).fit().summary().tables[1]) # Create a scatter plot with a linear regression trendline fig = px.scatter(old_faithful[short_wait], x='waiting', y='duration', title="Old Faithful Geyser Eruptions for short wait times (<"+str(short_wait_limit)+")", trendline='ols') fig.show() # USE `fig.show(renderer="png")` FOR ALL GitHub and MarkUs SUBMISSIONS

To determine whether there is evidence of a relationship between duration and waiting time for short wait times in the Old Faithful dataset, you can follow these steps using the provided code:

### 1. Restrict the Dataset to Short Wait Times

The code snippet you provided restricts the dataset to observations where the waiting time is less than a specified limit (`short_wait_limit`). By doing this, you can analyze whether the relationship observed in the full dataset holds true when focusing only on shorter wait times.

### 2. Analyze the Evidence Against the Null Hypothesis

Let's break down the process:

1. **Run the Code for Different Limits**
    
    You need to run the code snippet for each value of `short_wait_limit` (62, 64, 66) to analyze the results:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `import plotly.express as px import statsmodels.formula.api as smf  short_wait_limit = 62 # Change to 64 or 66 as needed short_wait = old_faithful.waiting < short_wait_limit  # Fit the model and print the summary table model_summary = smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[short_wait]).fit().summary().tables[1] print(model_summary)  # Create and show the scatter plot with trendline fig = px.scatter(old_faithful[short_wait], x='waiting', y='duration',                   title="Old Faithful Geyser Eruptions for short wait times (<"+str(short_wait_limit)+")",                   trendline='ols') fig.show(renderer="png")`
    
2. **Interpret the Output**
    
    Examine the `summary().tables[1]` output, which provides the regression coefficients and associated p-values. Focus on:
    
    - **Slope Coefficient (β₁) for `waiting`:** This represents the change in eruption duration for each additional minute of waiting time.
    - **P-value for the Slope Coefficient:** This tests the null hypothesis that the slope (β₁) is zero. If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis, indicating evidence of a relationship.
3. **Visualize the Data**
    
    The scatter plot with a trendline helps visualize the relationship. Look for:
    
    - **Trendline Slope:** Indicates whether there is an observable trend between waiting time and eruption duration for short wait times.
    - **Scatter Pattern:** If the data points show a clear trend along the trendline, it supports the presence of a relationship.

### Interpretation for Different Limits

- **For `short_wait_limit = 62`:** Analyze the output and plot. If you find a significant slope with a p-value less than 0.05, it suggests that even for very short wait times (less than 62 minutes), there is still a relationship between waiting time and eruption duration.
- **For `short_wait_limit = 64`:** Repeat the analysis and compare results. Changes in significance or slope might indicate how sensitive the relationship is to different thresholds of short wait times.
- **For `short_wait_limit = 66`:** Similarly, examine this limit to understand how the relationship holds for even longer short wait times.

By running the analysis for each of these limits, you can assess whether the relationship between eruption duration and waiting time persists across different thresholds of short wait times. If the relationship is consistent, it suggests that the observed trend in the full dataset is robust even when focusing on shorter wait times.
