    "#### Demo [60 minutes]  \n",
    "1. Use ChatGPT to create a school related simulated dataset for multiple linear regression to first demonstrate simple linear regression using [smf](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.html) and [sm](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.html).\n",
    "    1. Review different types of variables.\n",
    "    2. Show the standard formula for simple linear regression (include the difference between beta hat and beta, error, and $R^2$. \n",
    "2. Use the created dataset to demonstrate multiple linear regression using [smf](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.html) and [sm](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.html).\n",
    "    1. Illustrate interactions.\n",
    "    2. Show the standard formula for multiple linear regression (expand on the meaning of addition and multiplication of _variables_)\n",
    "3. Describe potential problems when dealing with multiple linear regression including how can you tell the issues through the ols table (e.g. Cond. No.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[8 minutes]** break into 4 groups of 6, and select 1 person as the protagonist of the story. \n",
    "    1. **[10 minutes]** Come up with a story surrouding this person with 2 or more affecting factors *(independent variables)* and a result *(dependent variable)* that the group want to predict based on the factors they have. The group should also consider 1 or more interactions constructed from the variables as a new factor. `For example: Good grade (dependent variable) might be affected by length of sleep (independent variable 1), time spent in studying (independent variable 2), and a combination of them (the new factor). `\n",
    "    2. **[12 minutes]** Present the story to other groups. After each group presents, other groups should vote whether the variables and interactions are appropiate. If not, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homework [0 minutes]\n",
    "> Imagine a company that sells sports equipment. The company runs advertising campaigns on TV and online platforms. The effectiveness of the TV ad might depend on the amount spent on online advertising and vice versa, leading to an interaction effect between the two advertising mediums.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discuss with ChatGPT on what are the possible variables in this scenario and talk about whether there could be any interactions in the given scenario? If so, write down 2 formulas (one with interaction and one without) in the format we learned today without the help of ChatGPT. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find an interesting data set given the above scenario using ChatGPT.\n",
    "    A. Try plotting its ols line using px.scatter (it should be a 3d graph showing the effect of interaction). \n",
    "    B. What do you observe on the graph about the effect of interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Discuss with ChatGPT the differences between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression and summarize your preference for one or the other and your rationale for this preference, including comments on interactions and indicator functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ask ChatGPT whether the following OLS result shows a good fit, and extend your study on R-squared, F-statistic, AIC and BIC, and Coefficients and P-values. Try explaining in your own words how does each suggests a strong or a weak fit.\n",
