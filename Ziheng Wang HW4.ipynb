    "1. Why do we care about the population parameter versus the sample statistic in statistics?\n",
    "Think of the population parameter as the big picture — it's like the \"true value\" of something you're trying to measure, like the average height of all people in the world. But here's the catch: we usually can’t measure the whole population. It's like trying to ask every single person in the world about their height — that would take forever!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we take a sample — a smaller group — and calculate a sample statistic from it, like the average height in our group. This sample statistic gives us a clue about the population parameter, but it’s not exactly the same, because it’s just based on a portion of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we make confidence intervals, we're trying to say, \"Based on our sample, here's a range where we think the true population parameter is likely to be.\" It helps us bridge the gap between what we know (the sample) and what we want to know (the population).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What’s a confidence interval?\n",
    "Imagine you have a dartboard, and you're aiming for the bullseye (the true population parameter), but you’re not sure exactly where it is. So, instead of hitting a single point, you throw a bunch of darts (like different samples). Some darts land close to the bullseye, some further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is like saying, \"I’m pretty sure the bullseye is somewhere in this zone where most of my darts landed.\" For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we threw darts (took samples) over and over, 95% of the time, that zone would contain the bullseye (the true population value).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it's a way of being fairly confident that you're capturing the truth, even though you don’t know exactly where it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why don’t we just calculate one number instead of a range (confidence interval)?\n",
    "Good question! The thing is, when you’re dealing with samples, there’s always some natural uncertainty. The sample you collect is just one possible snapshot of a much larger population. It’s like if you grabbed a handful of jellybeans from a jar — your handful might have mostly red jellybeans, but the jar might actually have more blues overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "That uncertainty is why we don’t just calculate one number. If we only gave a single number, we’d be acting like we know for sure what the population parameter is, but we don’t! By giving a range (confidence interval), we’re acknowledging that uncertainty and saying, “Hey, the true value is probably somewhere in this range.”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why do confidence intervals change when we use different statistics, like the mean or median?\n",
    "Different statistics (mean, median, etc.) tell us different things about our data. The mean is like the balancing point of all the data, while the median is the middle value when everything’s sorted. Since they focus on different aspects of the data, their confidence intervals will vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset with a few extreme values (like some really high or low numbers), the mean might get pulled toward those extremes, while the median stays closer to the middle. So, if you calculate confidence intervals for the mean and median, they’ll give you different ranges, reflecting how each statistic behaves with the data."
