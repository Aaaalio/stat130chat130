# Project: Vaccine data 

## Overview:
The company AliTech has created a new vaccine that aims to improve the health of the people who take it. Your job is to use what you have learned in the course to show if the vaccine is effective or not. 

## Data:
The data they have provided is given bellow:
~~~csv
PatientID,Age,Gender,InitialHealthScore,FinalHealthScore
1,45,M,50,80
2,34,F,60,90
3,29,M,40,70
4,52,F,55,85
5,37,M,65,95
6,41,F,50,80
7,33,M,45,75
8,48,F,70,90
9,26,M,55,85
10,39,F,60,80

## Deliverables
While you can choose how to approach the project we want to following to be noticeable in your report. 

You will be marked off these deliverables

- Describe the data given to you with a graph that has the `InitialHealthScore` and `InitialHealthScore` distributions so the user can compare.
- Create a method to quantitatively analyse the health improvement (explain what you choose and why)
- Create a null hypothesis that you will use to conclude after analysing the data
- Analyse the data and create a meaningful graph
- Analyse graph and write a conclusion for hypothesis (1 paragraph)
- You will also be marked on documentation of your code and how clean your notebook is

## Important notes:
1. When using random functions use seed 130
2. Data must be read from a CSV file do now make a dictionary of the data
3. Do not submit the CSV file
4. make sure to run all cells before turning in on markus
5. You will be using the template given to you (Do not change the titles of each section)
