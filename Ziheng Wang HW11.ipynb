    "1. Accuracy\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Medical diagnosis systems where false positives and false negatives have similar consequences. For instance, predicting whether someone has a mild allergy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "Accuracy is effective when the class distribution is balanced, and misclassification costs are similar for all classes. It provides a simple measure of how often the model is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Precision\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Fraud detection in banking systems, where it’s crucial to minimize false positives (e.g., flagging legitimate transactions as fraud).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "Precision focuses on the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. It’s critical when the cost of false positives is high, ensuring high confidence in positive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recall (Sensitivity)\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Disease screening programs, like cancer detection, where missing a positive case (false negative) could have severe consequences.\n",

    "Recall emphasizes capturing as many actual positive cases as possible, which is essential when false negatives carry a high cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. F1 Score\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Spam email detection, where both false positives (important emails marked as spam) and false negatives (spam emails getting through) need to be balanced.\n",

    "5. ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Credit risk assessment models used by financial institutions, where the model needs to distinguish between risky and non-risky borrowers over various thresholds.\n",

    "Rationale:\n",
    "ROC-AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds. It’s useful in applications where the operating point (threshold) may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Specificity\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Testing for a rare condition where false positives lead to unnecessary anxiety or expensive follow-up tests, such as genetic testing for a rare disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale:\n",
    "Specificity measures the ability to correctly identify negative cases. It’s important when false positives have significant costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "Application Scenario:\n",
    "Forecasting stock prices or house prices, where the focus is on minimizing the magnitude of prediction errors.\n",
