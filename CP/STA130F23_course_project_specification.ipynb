    "\n",
    "> Special thanks to [Dr. Nathalie Moon](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/nathalie-moon) who has developed the inital structure used for STA130 course projects. All course project designs outside of the initial two **Introduction** and **Canadian Statistical Literacy Poster Competition** sections below leverage the course project designs developed by Dr. Moon. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we'll use for the Fall 2024 STA130 course project is based on the [Canadian Social Connection Survey](https://casch.org/cscs) (CSCS) run by [genwell](https://genwell.ca/) and the [Canadian Alliance for Social Connection and Health](https://casch.org/) (CASCH). This data is used to produce [Rapid Evidence Briefs](https://casch.org/publications) which scientifically analyze the importance of social connection and community engagement -- relationships with family, friends, coworkers, neighbours, and strangers -- for personal health and well-being. The purpose of our course project is to help raise awareness about and interest in this often under appreciated topic. To do so STA130 students will do \"data blitz\" to discover interesting information and identify key statistics hidden inside the CSCS data. The findings each project team produces will be shared with other UofT courses (in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.) and other genwell and CASCH associated teams specializing in communications and media relations, and they will transform the most interesting findings of our teams into content for social media campaigns. If our findings are important enough, they may even form the basis of future Rapid Evidence Briefs...\n",
    "\n",
    "> In conjunction with this project, we are taking part in a research project \"investigating the impact of community engaged learning on student happiness, satisfaction, and well-being\" (alongside multiple courses in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Human Biology, and Psychology). We are curious to know if this project gives you a sense of engagement and contribution to our broader Canadian community, and how this potential possibility to express your altruistic tendencies turn might influence your own experience in the course and in your own personal life. So, we're exploring data investigating \"the importance of social connection and community engagement\" while at the same time exploring the relevance and impact of this course project activity to our own sense of \"connection and community engagement\" and it's potential benefits to \"personal health and well-being\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this data ethically, professionally, and appropriately we must take a quick look and abide by the [data use agreement](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60283c2e174c122f8ebe0f39/t/6239c284d610f76fed5a2e69/1647952517436/Data+Use+Agreement+for+the+Canadian+Social+Connection+Survey.pdf). You should also take a quick look at the [list of available variables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISVymGn-WR1lcRs4psIym2N3or5onNBi/view) and then check out the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbUQlMTrNYA7Ly5eImVRBn16Ehy9Lggo/view) itself (available at the bottom of the [CSCS](https://casch.org/cscs) webpage).\n",

    "This project was originated and sourced [by Christine Ovcaric](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7232457815112450048/) of UofT's [Experiential Learning Sandbox](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/experiential-learning/curriculum-integrated/sandbox) program, who connected Prof. Schwartz [Dr. Kiffer Card](https://casch.org/kiffer-card) \n",

    "- Director of Research for GenWell\n",
    "- Assistant Professor with the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University\n",
    "- Etc., you get the point...\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Card's objectives for this project are as introduced above, but this also offers STA130 students the opportunity to practice applying the skills and methods they're learning in STA130 on some real-world data that has the potential to actually matter. Summary statistics, visualizations, group comparisons, and associations and classification are all likely to be useful in the searching through the CSCS survey dataset to see what it tells us about social connection and well-being. As also described above, this project additionally gives STA130 students an opportunity to \"give back\" by contributing to a meaningful effort to understand key factors that contributed to improved personal health. STA130 students are likely to be able to intuitively understand and explore many of the variables as they work to identify key findings in the CSCS survey datasets and provide the initial analyses that could be the seeds of social media campaigns presenting findings that genwell wants to share with the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Canadian Statistical Literacy Poster Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to [Dr. Bethany White](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/bethany-white) who has pointed us to the [ISLP National Competition](https://islp.ssc.ca/), STA130 students have the potential to immediately engage in an opportunity that extends beyond the context of STA130. To see the requirements for participation, click \"Register\" or \"How to Participate\" on [https://islp.ssc.ca](https://islp.ssc.ca). The formatting of the submission for the competition is non-trivially different than what is submitted for the course project in the context of STA130, but there is time for this with an initial deadline associated with this opportunity of December 31, 2024; and a final deadline of February 28th, 2025. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engaing in research early on (as a first-year student) can be very challenging given the limited number of relevant opportunities and the strong competition for these roles. Therefore, students need to begin preparing their resumes and experiences to justify their appropriateness for selection for research opportunities.  The STA130 course projet certainly provides such an example which students should introduce, emphasize, and discuss in order to describe their experience to date in a research capacity. However, even with a well-articulated explanation of your activities and contributions within the \"course project\" context, the experience remains a \"course project\".  The Canadian Statistical Literacy Poster Competition is a way to demonstrate that your work on the STA130 course project is something more. An entry into the competition signals a serious persuit and belief in the work you did for the STA130, and who knows, it might even be nationally recognized. This would certainly make for a very notable indication of a students future research potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this presents yet an even further possibility. In a communication with Prof. Schwartz, Dr. Card indicated that, \"if someone were interested in publishing a paper or something like that [on the basis of the STA130 course project] then ... I could help guide them through. We've had [one paper published by a student](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1660-4601%2F19%2F18%2F11588&data=05%7C02%7Cscott.schwartz%40utoronto.ca%7Cbfa649ec07f34f436bb308dcc212eb8f%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C638598633732842785%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FPEHQlJRPnbrhacKzI6wgj8xLFbb1ufatUxXIoHNj8A%3D&reserved=0) off this dataset after they worked with it in one of my stats courses so it is certainly feasible!\". As you might have gathered, Dr. Card is a very busy individual; but, if you wanted to attempt to continue to pursue the research you begin as part of the STA130 course project, the first step would be to put together a submssion for the ISLP National Competition. This is the way you can \"message\" and \"signal\" sincere interest in continued engaement in this research that could be taken seriously. You would submit a poster for the ISLP Competition through Prof. Schwartz, and if appropriately Prof. Schwartz would then be able to facilitate a potential connection of a mentorship or collaborative nature with Dr. Card. So, if you're an ambitous student seeking to start putting together a record that could catalyze further research opportunities on the basis of the STA130 course project, [https://islp.ssc.ca](https://islp.ssc.ca) is the place to start... \n",

    "Students/Groups may book 15-minute \"side-conversations\" during normal TA OH periods [here](link). The purpose of these \"Optional Project Consultation\" is to give provide an opportunity to discuss the questions you're thinking about exploring and the methodologies you're thinking about using to do so in your Course Project. If booking for your group, only one person needs to sign up, and you're encouraged to attend with all your group members, but if some group members can't make it that's okay (since you can just report back to anyone who missed later). These appointments are available on a first-come first-served basis, so if you can no longer make the time you booked, please kindly 'un-reserve' your booking to return the timeslot to an \"available\" state. \n",

    "Each student will individually suggest three (3) distinct analyses that they plan to use to explore the CSCS data\n",
    "- Describe (a) the variables you plan to explore, and (b) the analysis you plan to perform\n",
    "- Describe (a) the possible results your analysis may produce, and (b) how this could be relevant for the objectives of the course project\n",
    "- Include your results if you have already completed an analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Your TUT TA will review each students individual submission and create 6 groups of 3-4 students from your TUT (not students from other TUTs) based on the interests expressed in these proposals, and/or previously observed during TUT. If students have preferences about which team members they'd like to work with, they should include these along with their submitted proposals. Ideally students who are \"more actively engaged\" in the courese will be grouped together, while students demonstrating \"less course participation\" will form their own group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All project assignment requirements are independent of group size. All groups, regardless of size, will be evaluated according to the same rubric. Given the nature of the Course Project and its objectives, it would be possible for even a single student to accel with respect to the rubrics of the Course Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a (recommended but optional) \"Current Course Project Capability Level\" section which guides students in applying the course topics from each week to the course project data. By Mon Nov04 students will have had exposure to the topics of Data Summarization, Visualization, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing, and Simple Linear regression, any combination of which would be appropriate choices for the proposed analyses. Student proposals don't necessarily have to be based on three different categories but a diverse proposal considering different approaches to exploring the project dataset likely would be. By Mon Nov04 students will not yet have enountered Mulitple Linear Regression or Decision Tree Classification, but they are welcome to propose analyses based on these methodologies if they are sufficiently familiar with these methodologies to do so sensibly. Students are also encouraged to integrate the considerations of the (recommended but optional) \"Ethical Profesionalism Considerations\" into their proposals.  Addressing \"ethics\" in these proposals is not a required aspect of this assignment, but demonstrating an awareness of these perspectives within the proposal will certainly be viewed favorably at this stage in the coure project. \n",

    "Group Project Slides and Presentation Recordings are due by Mon Dec02, and students will showcase their slides in the Project Poster Fair on Tue Dec03 (during the Thanksgiving day makeup class periods). After submitting  Individual Proposals (on Mon Nov04, immediately upon return from Reading Week) and subsequent group assignments, the sequence of assignments is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Week 10 HW: Mulitple Linear Regression (due Nov14)\n",
    "- Week 11 HW: Decision Tree Classification (due Nov21)\n",
    "- Course Project Practice Presentations (on Nov29)\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should be ready to begin working in their course project teams by Mon Nov04 (immediately upon return from Reading Week), and (given the tight timelines) teams should begin organizing and planning their work schedules as soon they are formed. Course project teams should ideally begin working on their Course Project Presentations in tandem with the Week 10 and 11 HW. The \"Current Course Project Capability Level\" section in these HW will remain \"recommended but optional\", but considering these section is much more strongly recommended and only technically optional at this stage. While it's by no means necessary that a Course Project utlilize Mulitple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classification, it's likely that teams will be able to make \"interesting findings\" relative to the objectives of the Course Project by leveraged these powerful methodologies to better understand the complexities of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Group Project Slides and Presentation Recordings due on Mon Dec02 will comprise (a maximum) of 23 slides. These will be arranged in an 6x4 grid on posters for the Project Poster Fair on Tue Dec03, where Individual Q&A Performance will be evaluated. During the Fri Nov29 TUT, the six teams will present their draft slides for feedback from the TA and other students. Each team will have 10-minutes to demonstrate their progress (clearly indicating individual members contributions) and any expected plans for finalizing their Course Project Slides; then, there will be 5-minutes for the TA and students to provide feedback to the team. To make the most of this feedback opportunity, the teams should ideally put some preparation and care into planning how they will use their 10-minutes to provide an orientation to their work and explain each individual members contributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 points of this assignment will be based on the TAs will assessment individual members contributions as of Nov29. The quality of the Practice Presentation is only important insofar as it is indicative of individual members contributions to date. The \"final\" and \"polished\" nature of the Course Project itself will be judged based on the Mon Dec02 submissions. It is possible that a TA may find multiple (or even all) individual members contributions to not meet expectations. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- The group formation process, and creating of Course Project teams within TUTs (and not across different TUTs) will ideally result in productive group dynamics; but, group dynamics can be dysfunctional.\n",
    "- Given that your TUT TA will have some famililarity with the dynamics of your Course Project teams, your TUT TA (in collaboration with the course Prof) will make all final decisions regarding concerns about group dynamics.\n",
    "    - Course Project teams should do their best to internally and collaboratively address concerns with individual members contributions (with appropriate agreement and expectation setting and minimal conflict wherever possible) and only raise concerns to their TUT TA (directly or via sta130@course.utoronto.ca) as a last resort\n",
    "    - There will likely be very little opportunity for intervention if concerns are raised after the Practice Presentations on Fri Nov29.\n",
    "    - TAs may remove non-contributing group members from otherwise productive groups if they (in collaboration with the course Prof) determine this to be necessary and appropriate; but, students removed from groups will forfeit their eligibility to receive credit for all group-related aspects of the Course Project.\n",
    "- Navigating the dynamics of group teamwork is an important, even if potentially highly variable aspect of the STA130 Course Project. This is because it is a nearly unavoidable aspect of all statististical and data science work, which is inherrently collaborative in nature. In this respect, there is experience to be gained from even negative group dynamics, so do your best to take away something valuable from you Course Project group experience in STA130. \n",
    "    - Hopefully you won't, but if you find yourself in a particularly harrowing situation regarding dysfunctional group dynamics related to the STA130 Course Project, you may simply need to practice navigating the injustice that in life some people don't receive as much credit as they should, while others receive more credit than they are entitled to. Consider, however, who you'd rather be in such a situation: a person who works harder and does more, or a person who isn't actually able to contribute appropriately? In the long run, which of these people do you think stands the best chance of finding success and advancing through life in a meaningful way?\n",

    "[This is worth 8 course points, 45% of the project grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your (maximum) 23 Group Project Slides should present and explain three distinct analyses which (a) identify key information and statistics present in the CSCS survey dataset which could (b) form the basis of interesting social media posts as part of the content of social media campaigns, or (c) potentially even serve as the foundation on which a more extensive [Rapid Evidence Brief](https://casch.org/publications) are developed. Your Group Project Slides are what will be shared with other UofT courses (in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.) and genwell and CASCH associated teams specializing in communications and media relations for their consideration as a potenial \"interesting findings\" on which to base their efforts related to (b) and (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Group Project Slides are some sense parallel to the three (3) Individual Proposals each of your 3-4 Project Group team members created; but, they should reprsent the best and most promising analyses collaboratively produced through the efforts of your Project Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaboratively select three (3) research topics to address through your Group Project Slides\n",
    "    - As you think about what you might choose to pursue, remember that Dr. Card and his genwell and CASCH colleagues are trying to raise awareness about (and interest in) the relationship between social connection and community engagement -- relationships with family, friends, coworkers, neighbours, and strangers to personal health and well-being; however, ...\n",
    "    - You may present investigations which led to \"null findings\"; that is, research in which you hypothesized  a key finding which might be present in the data, but for which you in the end did not find sufficient statistical evidence for\n",
    "    - You are not required to use any of the same questions formulated during Individual Proposals, but certainly may; and, ideally those questions and the feedback you received on them will be useful in helping you think about the elements of interesting and meaningful questions for the objectives of the Course Project (and its target audience)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As Dr. Card says, \"The CSCS survey dataset gives students a chance to gain experience with messy, real-world data!\"\n",
    "    - There is a lot of missing data and substructure that must be addressed with some \"data wrangling\" and  \"EDA\" (exploratory data analysis, using plots and summary statistics).\n",
    "    - Many statistical and data science analyses (of confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, regression and/or classification models) will be relevantly applicable to the CSCS survey dataset, but your project should be selective rather than exaustive with your use of methodologies, applying them as tools to support the specific intentions of your research questions. \n",
    "        - Make sure the visualizations and methododologies you choose to use make sense for the questions you are trying to answer! Some of the statistical and data science techniques we've covered in this course are not useful to answer certain research question. Choosing the appropriate tools to answer each of your questions is an important part of this project, the the way you present and visualize your analyzis needs to be tailed to and meaningful for the objectives of the Course Project (and its target audience).\n",
    "                \n",
    "    - There are more variables in the CSCS survey dataset than you will be able to understand in a single semester; so, quickly zero in the ones that you think are the most relevant or interesting \n",
    "        - You do not need to use all the observations from all the different studies included in CSCS survey dataset; rather, think carefully about the questions your group is exploring, the story you are telling with your analysis, and then focus on the subset of data you need to address your questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to carry out an exhaustive analysis, nor to apply everything you have learned in the course. The goal is to demonstrate that\n",
    "\n",
    "- you have learned how to use `Python` as a tool in the statistical and data sciencde analysis context\n",
    "- while appropriately applying the methods we have covered in class to address interesting questions\n",

    "\n",
    "For the `Python` version of STA130, you may use your preferred slide deck creation tool (such as powerpoint or prezi, etc.). In the `R` version of STA130, you'd be \"knitting\" RMarkdown `.Rmd` files to pdf slides. This would allow you combine your analysis and presentation slides into a single reproducible and sharable \"analysis+slides\" file (which is a big plus when it comes to communicating scientific analyses). We'll (unfortunately) not be attempting to create utilize a reproducible and sharable \"analysis+slides\" for the Fall 2024 STA130 sections (although this may be supported in the future with [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)); so, as you're creating your slides, you must do the following...\n",

    "1. Write your slides so that someone who only has your slides and the CSCS survey dataset could \"validate\" your results and conclusions by \"reproducing\" your analysis (at least approximately)\n",
    "    1. This DOES NOT mean your slides should just be a \"printout\" of your code and analysis: \n",
    "    2. your Project Slides should be a \"presentation\" of the results of your analysis in the traditional sense, not a transcript dump of your code and it's output...\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Consider how you would need to organize your analysis in your `.ipynb` files in conjunction with your slides so that your work could be shared, validated, and reproduced exactly by someone else in the future \n",
    "    1. There is potential and very likely would be opportunity to continue the research you start in this project if you chose to pursue it, so \"someone else\" could actually be \"you\"...\n",
    "    2. We want to share our teams' findings with other UofT courses (in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.) and other genwell and CASCH associated teams specializing in communications and media relations so they can use them to create social media campaigns or expand on them to write Rapid Evidence Briefs... ideally we'd be able to seamlessly share or resume the analyses done during the Course Project, but this can be hard to do (when it comes to communicating scientific analyses) if you don't intentionally and carefully organize your work in a sharable manner...\n",

    "#### Writing style\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use bullet points to organize the main information under each section in a logical sequence\n",
    "- Choice of language is appropriate for the intended non-technical audience of the Course Project objectives\n",

    "    - Is there enough information to allow someone to replicate your work while excluding excessive details?\n",
    "    - Is there too much jargon that would limit the ability of a non-technical audience member to appreciate and follow the purpose and conclusions of your work? \n",
    "        - There's no printed `Python` output shown, right?! While STA130 students are indeed learning to \"read\" and \"speak\" the language of our technical tools, it's seems unlikely that this would be particularly useful for a non-technical audience member...\n",
    "    - The slides onely have text, figures, and tables (and maybe \"formulas\" clarifying linear model or classification analyses), right?\n",

Of course you'll need to interpret such situations and analyses correctly... it won't due to report that you've found statistical evidence for something when that's actually not justified by the data...\n",

The audience for this presentation is our potential future collaborators\n",
    "- Dr. Kiffer Card\n",
    "- UofT students from courses in Digital Humanities, Writing, Sociology, etc.\n",
    "- and other teams associated genwell and CASCH  \n",
    "all of whom are primarily interested in raising awareness of and interest in the relationship between social connection and well-being. Nonetheless, for our project, your recording summarizing and orienting us to our work can be targetted towards either of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Interesting findings\" that could form the basis of the content of social media posts as part of the content of social media campaigns\n",
    "2. \"Scientific investigation\" oriented towards forming the foundation foundation upon which a more extensive [Rapid Evidence Brief](https://casch.org/publications) should be developed\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the audience and objectives of the recording, the presentation shouldn't be too technical but rather focus on the reasons why the questions and results are relevant to the collaborator, what they can do with the insights obtained, along with an indication of the nature of the analysis and evidence supporting the conclusions of the team. \n",

    "#### Recording requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The video must be between 4-6 minutes in length (recorded at normal speed). Each group member must appear in the video and be visably identifiable when speaking (probably through a recorded Zoom session using screen sharing with a sufficiently sized speaker thumbnail). All group members should speak approximately the same amount of time (about 1-1.5 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the limited time, your assignment is to address the following required elements in your video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a brief overview of each research question investigated (and the theme connecting each research question to the overarching project goal)\n",
    "- Then for each research question\n",
    "    - Provide ae dscription and rationale for any new variables that were created or observations that were excluded\n",
    "    - Provide a description of statistical and/or data science methodologies brought to bear on the research question\n",
    "    - Provide an interpretation of the results you obained (even if they are \"null findings\")\n",
    "    - Provde the overall findings and conclusions (across all research questions) produced by your team\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what you will be evaluated on here is the decisions your group makes about what is most important to share in the recording, and how you are able to effectively communicate this information clearly and concisely to the intended audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your \"submitted video\" must be a URL link to your recording stored MyMedia \n",
    "- You URL link must must be accessible without a password\n",
    "- See the instructions [here](link)\n",

    "- The \"elevator pitch\" should provide the rationale for the chosen research questions and main findings without any details about the analyses.\n",
    "- Groups must then be available to answer follow-up questions for up to 10-minutes, first allowing 5-minutes for the student or TA to examine and consider the Course Project Poster after hearing the \"elevator pitch\", and then having a 5-minute Q&A conversation.\n",

The TA may choose to assign a single common grade to all individual groups members; but, this is technically an \"individual\" evaluation, ranging from \"0 (the student didn't participate in the \"elevator pitch\" or the Q&A session)\" to \"2 (this student is awesome... we expect to keep seeing great things from them in the future)\".\n",

Two of the evaluations will address other Course Projects, while the remaining evaluation will be based on their own course project (with particular reference to their own contributions within their Course Project relative to the other group members). The evaluations of the two other Course Projects should be structure in the format of \"constructive critical feedback\" which could be made available to the teams being evaluated. The evaluation of your own performance on the course project should be self-reflective and address what you did well and do not do well, and what went well and did not go well regarding teamwork within the group. \n",
